          Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) is similar to Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) as it is made from high quality coal, wood or coconut shell raw material. PAC is typically considered to have particles less than U.S standard 80 mesh size, which makes it ideal for water treatment.

          Powdered activated carbons (PAC) are defined by the ASTM as particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177 mm) and smaller. EE Carbon manufactures many types of powdered activated carbon products, each specifically engineered to provide a unique pore structure and adsorption properties.
By varying manufacturing conditions, internal pore structures are created by imparting unique adsorption properties specific to each product type. The choice of product for a specific application will vary due to differing impurities and proprietary process conditions.</p>
<p className='text-justify md:text-xl md:leading-[36.7px] max-sm:leading-[14.68px] font-normal max-sm:text-[8px] montserrat'>
The adsorptive capacity of EE Carbon’s powdered activated carbon (PAC) makes it ideal for removing a variety of contaminants from water, air, liquids and gases. With efforts to be environmentally responsible, EE Carbon can reactivate spent Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) through thermal oxidation to make “react” PAC.</p>
<p className='text-justify md:text-xl md:leading-[36.7px] max-sm:leading-[14.68px] font-normal max-sm:text-[8px] montserrat'>
EE Carbon backs its products with comprehensive analytical support including feasibility studies and cost evaluations, together with complete system design, service, and troubleshooting. Customers get the expertise of an industry expert in powdered activated carbon backed by a commitment to service one can trust.
